      <p> My name is Jacqueline Gwynn and I am a native resident of North Carolina. I was born in Caswell County which
        is approximately 60 miles from RDU. Growing up in a small rural town in NC was interesting and fun. In my spare
        time I love to shop, hang out with friend and family, and music.</p>

      <p>I have 2 children and 2 dogs. My daughter is twenty years old and my son is seven. I am a continuous learner
        as I have studied at North Carolina Central University for my bachelors. I went back to school and received two
        Masters degrees from University of Phoenix.</p>

      <p>I have currently been employed at Fidelity Investments for the last 14 years. I transitioned from an
        operations background to technology 6 years ago. I taught myself how to automate and I am now looking forward
        to some formal training as a developer.</p>
